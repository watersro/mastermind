# Mastermind

This is a digital version of the game mastermind! It has been fun yet challenging to make and it's the same experience playing!

## To Play

This is a CLI version, and is played against the computer currently. If you choose to be a codebreaker, you try to crack the code based off clues given by the computer. If you choose to make the code, the computer tries to (and usually succeeds in) breaking the code. There are 12 rounds per game, enjoy!
